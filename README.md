# Youtube Ad Skipper
 Python is the programming language that was utilized to make this app. It automatically chooses the "skip ad" option on YouTube ads. It does this by utilizing the opencv package's Template Matching functionality. It retrieves templates for the skip ad button for various screen sizes and zoom levels in order to be platform agnostic. It works well on a wide range of PCs with different resolutions.
