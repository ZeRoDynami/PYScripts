# Youtube Ad Skipper
 Python is the programming language that was utilized to make this app. It automatically chooses the "skip ad" option on YouTube ads. It does this by utilizing the opencv package's Template Matching functionality. It retrieves templates for the skip ad button for various screen sizes and zoom levels in order to be platform agnostic. It works well on a wide range of PCs with different resolutions.
# Basic firewall script
This script creates a basic firewall that listens on a specified port (firewall_port) and blocks incoming connections on ports not listed in the allowed_ports set. This is just a starting point, and you may need to adapt it to your specific needs.
# DDos Detector
Detecting Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks is a complex task that typically involves monitoring network traffic patterns, identifying anomalies, and implementing various mitigation strategies. Below is a simplified Python script that demonstrates a basic approach to detecting a sudden increase in incoming network requests, which could indicate a potential DDoS attack.
